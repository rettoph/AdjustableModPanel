**Version 1.5.3**
KSP 1.8

**Version 1.5.2**
KSP 1.7
Ignore buttons with no texture

**Version 1.5.1**
KSP 1.6
Small fix

**Version 1.5**
Fixed to work with the latest ToolbarControl 0.1.6.6 (older versions won't work).
Implemented "pin mod" functionality. There is no guarantee of the exact mods order, but all the pinned mods will be shown before all the others. Adjustable Mod Panel will always remain in the first place, though.

**Version 1.4**
KSP 1.4

**Version 1.3**
Added support for ToolbarControl. No other changes. If you do not use ToolbarControl, you can ignore this update.

**Version 1.2**
Mod icon is now also taken into account when trying to distinguish one mod from another. That should fix the issue with the "Science!" mod.

**Version 1.1**
Now the mod can disable itself. It can't be disabled in KSC, so you'll never lose access to the mod.
