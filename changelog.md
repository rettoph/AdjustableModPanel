## Version 1.5.3

* KSP 1.8

---

## Version 1.5.2

* KSP 1.7
* Ignore buttons with no texture

---

## Version 1.5.1

* KSP 1.6
* Small fix

---

## Version 1.5

* Fixed to work with the latest ToolbarControl 0.1.6.6 (older versions won't work).
* Implemented "pin mod" functionality.
* There is no guarantee of the exact mods order, but all the pinned mods will be shown before all the others.
* Adjustable Mod Panel will always remain in the first place, though.

---

## Version 1.4

* KSP 1.4

---

## Version 1.3

* Added support for ToolbarControl.
* No other changes.
* If you do not use ToolbarControl, you can ignore this update.

---

## Version 1.2

* Mod icon is now also taken into account when trying to distinguish one mod from another.
* That should fix the issue with the "Science!" mod.

---

## Version 1.1

* Now the mod can disable itself.
* It can't be disabled in KSC, so you'll never lose access to the mod.
